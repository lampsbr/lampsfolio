# I loved to blog back in college, I had time, had something to say...

And also I knew what to use as subtitle/chapeau! Clearly you can't save all skills after neglecting them for about 15 years. But it is exciting to have a place to write something. Ops, just forgot I can post in 700 different social networks. I hope this Hugo engine features RSS integration somewhere. I'm a big fan of Aaron Swartz works, I miss the web2 google reader days, and I still try to use it's best successor, Inoreader!
